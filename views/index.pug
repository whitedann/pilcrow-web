    p.lead.mt-5.mx-5 Pilcrow is a simple collaborative writing app. Write a sentence and submit it to a thread. After one hundred contributions, the thread closes. 
    p.lead.mt-5.mx-5 The only catch? You can only see the most recently added sentence to the thread. Once a thread closes, you'll be able to read the whole thread. What will it say? Will it be a magical story of wizards and hobbits? A recipe for lemon blueberry pound cake? A dramtic retelling of the dead sea scrolls? Probably just nonsense.
